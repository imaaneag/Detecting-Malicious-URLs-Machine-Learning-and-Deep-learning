# Detecting-Malicious-URLs-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-learning

The purpose of this poject is to use the structural features of the URL to detect malicious URLs using supervised, unsupervised algorithms of machine learning and multi-layer neural network in deep learning.
So our goal is to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorethms to detect malicious URLs, using a set of tagged URL data, which are presented here https://www.kaggle.com/code/siddharthkumar25/detect-malicious-url-using-ml/data. We test different algorithms and models to identify the most relevant features for detecting malicious URLs, and to compare the performance of different techniques.
